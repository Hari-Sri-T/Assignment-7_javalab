# Calculator Application (With Exception Handling)

This project is a simple Java-based calculator application that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), generate a Fibonacci sequence, and calculate the sum and average of an array.

## Files

1. **UserInput.java**  
2. **Calculator.java**  
3. **Main.java**

## UserInput.java

This class handles taking input from the user.

### Methods:
- **calcInput()**  
  - Description: Takes two integers as input from the user.  
  - Returns: An array of integers (`int[2]`).
  
- **fiboInput()**  
  - Description: Takes the number of terms for the Fibonacci sequence from the user.  
  - Returns: An integer (`int`) representing the number of terms.

- **arrInput(int size)**  
  - Description: Takes an array of integers from the user, where the size of the array is provided as an argument.  
  - Parameters: `size` (int) - The size of the array.  
  - Returns: An integer array (`int[]`).

## Calculator.java

This class implements several mathematical operations and utilities.

### Methods:
- **addition()**  
  - Description: Adds two integers input by the user.  
  - Returns: The sum of the two integers (`int`).

- **substraction()**  
  - Description: Subtracts the second integer from the first integer input by the user.  
  - Returns: The difference of the two integers (`int`).

- **multiplication()**  
  - Description: Multiplies two integers input by the user.  
  - Returns: The product of the two integers (`int`).

- **division()**  
  - Description: Divides the first integer by the second, handling division by zero.  
  - Returns: The quotient (`double`), or 0 if division by zero occurs.

- **fibonnaci()**  
  - Description: Generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the number of terms input by the user.  
  - Returns: None.

- **sumAverageArr(int size)**  
  - Description: Takes an array of integers, calculates their sum and average, and prints the results.  
  - Parameters: `size` (int) - The size of the array.  
  - Returns: None.

## Main.java

This is the entry point of the application where the user can select various operations.

### Methods:
- **main(String[] args)**  
  - Description: Displays the menu and processes user input to call the relevant methods from the `Calculator` class.  
  - Options:  
    - 1) **Calculator**: Perform arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).  
    - 2) **Fibonacci**: Generate a Fibonacci sequence.  
    - 3) **Array (Sum and Average)**: Calculate the sum and average of an array of integers.  
    - 4) **Exit**: Exit the program.

## Exception Handling

This application includes exception handling to ensure the program can gracefully handle invalid inputs and runtime errors.

### Handled Exceptions:

1. **IllegalArgumentException**  
   - **Location**:  
     - In `UserInput.fiboInput()`  
     - Thrown when the number of terms for the Fibonacci sequence is 0 or negative.  
   - **Behavior**: Displays an error message if the input is not greater than 0.

2. **NegativeArraySizeException**  
   - **Location**:  
     - In `UserInput.arrInput()`  
     - Thrown when a negative size is provided for the array.  
   - **Handled in**:  
     - `Calculator.sumAverageArr()` using a try-catch block to prevent the program from terminating abruptly.

3. **ArithmeticException**  
   - **Location**:  
     - In `Calculator.division()`  
     - Thrown when the user tries to divide by zero.  
   - **Behavior**: Displays a message indicating division by zero is not allowed, and returns 0 as a fallback.

4. **InputMismatchException**  
   - **Location**:  
     - In all input methods in `UserInput.java`  
     - Thrown when the user enters invalid data types (e.g., entering a string instead of an integer).  
   - **Behavior**: Prompts the user repeatedly until valid input is received.

## How to Compile the Program

### Requirements:
- **Java JDK** (Java Development Kit) version 8 or higher.

### Steps to Compile and Run:

1. **Install Java JDK**:  
   Ensure you have the Java JDK installed. You can download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) or use your package manager if you're on Linux/macOS.

2. **Save the Files**:
   - Save the `Main.java`, `Calculator.java`, and `UserInput.java` files in the same directory or project folder.

3. **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt**:
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the Java files.

4. **Compile the Java Files**:
   - Run the following command to compile the Java files:
     ```
     javac *.java
     ```
     This command will compile all the `.java` files in the directory.

5. **Run the Program**:
   - After compiling, you can run the program with the following command:
     ```
     java Main
     ```
     This will start the program and display the main menu where you can select options to perform various operations.

### How to Use

1. **Start the program**: After running the program, a menu will be displayed with various options.

2. **Select an option**: Choose from the following options by entering the corresponding number:
   - `1` - **Calculator**: Perform arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
   - `2` - **Fibonacci**: Generate a Fibonacci sequence.
   - `3` - **Array (Sum and Average)**: Calculate the sum and average of an array of integers.
   - `4` - **Exit**: Exit the program.

3. **Calculator operations**: If you select **1) Calculator**, you will be prompted to choose one of the following operations:
   - `a` - **Addition**: Add two numbers.
   - `b` - **Subtraction**: Subtract the second number from the first.
   - `c` - **Multiplication**: Multiply two numbers.
   - `d` - **Division**: Divide the first number by the second (note: division by zero is not allowed).
   - `e` - **Go Back**: Go back to the main menu.

4. **Perform operations**: Depending on your selection, the program will ask for further input:
   - If you choose the **Calculator** option, you'll be asked to select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) and provide two numbers.
   - If you choose the **Fibonacci** option, you'll be asked to input the number of terms for the Fibonacci sequence.
   - If you choose the **Array (Sum and Average)** option, you'll be asked to provide the size of the array and then input the array elements.
